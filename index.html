				<p>
					Nature has appealed to the imagination for centuries and has been a great source of inspiration for
					humanity. Because of its cyclical and transformative aspect, ornaments of plants symbolise
					immortality. Through my personal research and experiences with nature and my roots, I started seeing
					the <em>Herbarium</em> as an ornament, and the garden as a <nobr>spiritual space.</nobr>
				</p>


				<p>
					This thesis will discuss the necessity of the garden and the botanical collections in the digital
					era. The garden and <em>Herbaria</em> gives us an immediate connection with nature that is often
					neglected with people in a digitised realm. Besides the spirituality and our appreciation of the
					garden, I will also touch upon some criticism of human interference <nobr>on nature,</nobr> causing
					immense degradation of the natural environment; that has made <nobr>us disconnected.</nobr>
				</p>

				<p>
					In this way, the purpose of this paper is to provide a critical and more inclusive understanding of
					the relationship between nature, humanity and technology, and how <nobr>to reconnect us.</nobr>

				<p>
					The garden is a piece of land where there is a constant movement of change that is influenced by
					time, weather and the inhabitants that engage with the objects surrounding them and the space. In
					the garden, the individual holds their own piece of nature; the gardener takes care of the life that
					grows in their own designed way. Taking into consideration to which plants need more sunlight; the
					time they take to bloom; which soil is best for the seed or simply just aesthetic preference. As a
					matter of fact, plants can show us the meaning of life, through the cycle of time. It is a place
					where we become more aware of the cycle of life and death; of re-birth, care and
					transformation, through the aesthetics of the floral world. But what has the garden actually been
					through and what can we still see in its contemporary design?
				</p>

				<p>
					The garden and <em>Herbaria</em> gives us an immediate connection with nature that is often
					neglected by people in a digitalized world. For centuries, we try to get a hold on
					the natural world with floral ornaments that make our urban environment more alive. They symbolize immortality and our desire for nature in a digital realm. Apart from its
					aesthetics, can the ornament also create an awareness of the stark narrative of the garden and
					herbaria to reconnect us with nature? Have we lost our appreciation for the garden? How can we come
					to a present where we can work with nature on a deeper spiritual level in this digitized age?

				<p>
					The garden is where physicality and mentality come together. A spiritual ground where the connection
					between nature and humanity are extremely close. All our daily sources come directly from nature:
					crops, medicines, water and oxygen, to name but a few. The animate and inanimate join forces and
					work together. As you plow the ground with your bare hands and carefully tend to the plants that
					shape your garden. Every encounter is thoughtful from cutting, weeding and watering your plants to
					quietly sitting amongst them and simply to listen to the buzzing of insects, the rustling of leaves
					and the flowers creating colourful landscapes. Nature gives us a pure pleasure, taking us out of the
					noise of the mechanical world. Being in nature, you enter a different world, one which becomes more
					symbolic, emotional and personal.
				</p>


				<p>
					This meditative side of the garden is best shown in Chinese culture. The garden designed using Feng
					Shui principles is to capture the environment’s natural rhythms and the spiritual equality between
					man and nature. Gentle curves of grasses and trees encourage wildlife in the garden with a positive
					and smooth energy flow; taking good care of the garden is very important.
				</p>

				<p>
					Western garden design stems from a culture of emphasizing modernity. Entertainment was very
					important, and created romantic memories of the garden. A large central space, various pools and a
					bandstand, alongside the symmetry of the design, stood for modernity. With the focus being more on
					the geometric order of the many species. On the contrary, the Hebrews for instance, focused way more
					on complementing the local landscape of the country and its indigenous plants, without any
					hierarchy.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another spiritual paradise, the

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-01" href="content/image_01.jpg"
						title="Image 01">Garden of Eden</a>


					, is a place where God created a colourful landscape where butterflies, bees, flowers and trees
					lived in harmony together with Adam and Eve, the gardeners. He promised them eternal life and
					happiness and all the food in the world. From this idealized

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="note-01" title="Note 1">Garden of Eden</a>

					arose a romantic view on the garden in Western culture, which later on transformed into a modern
					garden design with a clear hierarchical system of humanity taking control over nature.

					The past year, all the pressure from daily social, educational, digital and personal life felt
					overwhelming. I started going on walks in the city, going from public garden to public garden, to
					release some stress and distracted myself from this bubble that I had got into. Sometimes I sat in
					the park and just looked at the movement of the trees for a while. Nature can create calmness
					and peace with its continuity and rhythm. This movement is like entering a space of nothingness in a
					big world. During these small and sometimes longer hikes,&nbsp;I picked up flowers and leaves which
					I dried in my notebook. After a couple of days, I scanned the plants to have a digital clone and to preserve its shape, 
					color and beauty as long as possible. Just like that, the plants become eternal and my
					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-10" href="content/image_10.jpg"

					With this approach, I started seeing nature as a form of meditation and reflecting on myself, which

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-17" href="content/image_17.jpg"
						title="Image 17">drawing</a>
					 flowers and leaves for <em>The Memorial Herbarium</em>. Such a practical movement of drawing,
					created a sense of calmness and understanding of the shapes I was looking at. Looking at the
					collection of flowers and plants took me back to the memory of being at that specific spot where I
					picked them, with who I was, what I was feeling and doing. In this way, I see the collection of
					plants as a collection of memories and places that I could safe eternally.

					It is around -1 degrees Celsius, cloudy, a little damp and chilly. The Erasmus park in Amsterdam
					West is full of people who are either taking their dog for a walk, walking with colleagues during
					their lunch break, or people that are going for a run. The park is surrounded by a small moat. In
					front of the gate I look at the map of the park. My attention is drawn to the graphic of a strict
					grid which illustrates the walking paths in the park. Searching for the flower garden I softly
					mumble: Buurtpodium, Speelweide, Plantsoen. I continue my walk towards three small rectangular
					shapes on the right side of the park, called ‘the Plantsoen’.
				</p>

				<p class="observation">
					While walking through the park I pass about four signs that say ‘barbeque rules’. I imagined the
					park on a hot clammy summer’s day, with groups of melting people, barely dressed, the smoky smell of
					barbeque mixed with joints, loud music and lukewarm beer. I look at the pictures I took last summer.
					I miss the summer. I reminisce.

					In front of the huge plant boxes, there was a sign: ‘The Miracle Garden, Laboratorium voor
					bloemwonderen van kunstenaar Elspeth Diederix’ (The Miracle Garden, Laboratory for flower wonders by
					artist Elspeth Diederix). The small clinical white sign was a representation of how the garden
					looked. The plants were still in hibernation; it gave me the feeling of grief. The beautiful
					colourful and dark <a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-02-2"
						title="Miracle2 #01">photographs</a>
					of initiator Elspeth Diederix, had made me very excited to visit the garden. In her

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-02" title="Miracle2 #01">photos</a>, Diederix captures
					the beauty of nature in an almost surrealistic way. The images are not completely natural and always
					have a sense of artificiality in them. She creates and manipulates the image with lightning to give
					it a sensuous richness, but she never digitally manipulates them. They are like floral still life
					paintings from the 17th century. A bright colourful centerpiece, the lighting is just enough so that
					the composition makes your eyes move around the shapes, surrounded by a dark background. She is
					extremely good in creating a romantic image of nature.

					Real flowers were used on altars or to decorate the table to celebrate its lifelines and bring life
					in the house. Ornaments in particular, are historical art and craft pieces used to decorate products
					or buildings from the outside to the inside. In architecture, the ornament is an element added to
					what normally is a quite simple structured shape. It has aesthetic purposes to tell a narrative due
					to its decorative aspect. The ornament is created for human pleasure. Floral still life paintings
					are <em>imaginative herbaria</em> in a sense that they visually represent the flowers and their
					aesthetics, created by the human hand, to always have access to its beauty. The Dutch painters were
					obsessed with the shapes of the flowers for years which provided the perfect subject for their
					paintings. Constructing in this way their own herbarium collection, their own ornaments. Abraham van
					Beyeren painted a

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-04" title="Image 04">still&nbsp;life&nbsp;painting</a>

					with flowers recognizable as tulips, roses and carnations, none of which bloom at the same time. On
					the left side of the vase, van Beyeren painted a watch. Watches and clocks in that time were
					associated with immortality and the transience of human life. These art pieces are there to honor
					and desire for their fragility, skill, aesthetics and human connection to nature. They take us back
					to when we could enjoy and interact with our natural surroundings more than we do now in the digital

				<p>
					After centuries, the <em>Herbarium</em> is still very important for scientists and botanists and
					allows people to study the plants at their own ease apart from blooming times. Besides this
					scientific and practical approach, botanical gardens became a museum where science and beauty joined
					forces.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the <em>Herbarium</em>, creation is destruction. In order to research them, you have to pull out
					the plant and take them with you for further examination. In the past, because of their fragility,
					they were mostly drawn and etched to have a replication to research. This elimination can save
					plants from extinction caused by global warming, landscape destruction, or other human interference.
					The dried seeds can be saved for years, without losing their ability to reproduce. In this digital
					era, the collection of dried plants changed from piles of engraved illustrations into an online
					archive, making it accessible for people at the other side of the world. In this way, the form could
					be preserved eternally, making the <em>Herbarium</em> an immortal space of beauty.

				<p class="observation">
					In a greenhouse, exotic plants from all over the world are kept alive because of artificial
					temperature, humidity and air circulation. The paths lead you through the climates of dry scrubland,
					the desert and the jungle which are all situated in one location and locked in a huge structured
					glass cage. Looking in from the outside through the glass makes the place feel surreal and
					fantasy-like, like a paradise.

					Inside the greenhouse, the humidity immediately makes me feel stuffy. The plants are overwhelmingly
					large. For a second I feel small compared to them. Looking up through the extensive leaves, I see a

				<p class="observation">
					Visiting the Rijksmuseum continued a slightly uncomfortable feeling. In their collection, you get an

					on chairs, closets, beds, plates and cutlery, frames and of course the strokes in between the frames
					that create the ‘artificial’ flower.

				<p class="observation">
					Most of the painted flowers were rare and precious specimens, only available for the wealthiest

					Points of critic
				</p>

				<p>
					All the positive aspects of the garden and herbaria discussed in the previous chapters make me fall
					in love with nature over and over again. But alongside my research I came upon several critical
					points of view of the garden and botanical collections in the digital era.
				</p>

				<p>
					Referring to the first chapter <em>The Living Herbarium</em>, where I briefly talked about the
					Garden of Eden, this too has some negative effects on our and nature’s existence. Contrary to the
					harmony of paradise, where everything lives and works together, lies a hierarchical Western system.
					After the

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="image-06" title="Image 06">Fall</a>

					of the Garden of Eden, they had to take responsibility and care for their living environment with a
					dark thundercloud above their head. Where nature and humanity should have worked together in
					harmony, humanity took full control over nature. It is the start of seeing humanity at the top of
					the hierarchy and destroying and exhausting all natural resources and the wilderness.

					The biological taxonomy—the act of naming, describing, and classifying all plants in the
					world—became very important in the Age of Enlightment, alongside the classification and ordering of
					the world, because of the interest in rationality and logic. The collection of specimens in an
					<em>Herbarium</em> arose from an oppressive system of extracting botanical knowledge from indigenous
					people forced to work on the plantations, and usurping it. In this post-colonial era, we still see
					the effects of this exploitation in the garden and herbaria in the Netherlands. Maria Sibylla Merian
					had many scientific and also aesthetic achievements during the 17th century. Besides her fame, her
					research thrived because of colonialism and the slave trade. Her research consists of the
					exploitation and labour of enslaved African and indigenous guides, using their knowledge.

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="footnote-4" title="Footnote 4">4</a>

					To add to this, the rise of European territorial expansion and human interference in nature has
					caused a huge disappearance in native plants and biodiversity in the Netherlands, endangering the
					ecology.

					<a class="to-modal-image" data-link-id="footnote" title="Footnote">destroying the wilderness</a>

				<h2 class="blijft-plakken">Conclusion</h2>

				<p>
					Alongside all the positive aspects of the garden and Herbaria, the sociopolitical issues need to be
					addressed. This critical perspective is highly needed in order to move towards a more inclusive
					future of nature, humanity and technology. The digitalization of nature is positive for the memorial
					garden in order to save experiences eternally and to create a spiritual connection with the natural
					environment. While being aware of the human interference in nature, I cherish that the aesthetics of
					the digital replication of the flower, and so of my memories, will be saved eternally. The ornaments
					create a certain desire for nature, created through our individual experiences.

				<p>
					First, I would like to thank my mother and grandmother for showing me how to love and care for
					nature. I am grateful for the help of my aunt Andrea and her daughters Claire and Abi, for
					encouraging me to continue writing about a very personal and sometimes tricky subject. Finally, I want to thank my tutor Dirk Vis for always trying to clear my chaotic mind and helping me through my struggles and insecurities resulting in a piece of work that I am quite proud of.

[...] To live is to breathe and embrace in one’s breath all the matter of the world."</em> <br /><br /> Emanuele Coccia, Life of Plants
